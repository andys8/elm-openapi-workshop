# Step-3: Setting up the client code

As we have set up basically everything, let's play now with our new tools.

## Exercises

1. Include server-sdk (client) files in your elm project by editing `elm.json`. Have a look at (`source-directories`)
2. Add a button to fetch the insurances list from your backend.
3. Add a form to add new insurances.
4. Add new fields to your insurance type (such as `premium`, `propertyType` or `surrenderValue` or `isBurnedDown`) and integrate the changes in your client code.
